# Project Title:

Overview:

Question Answering System model helps generate answers for the questions in an
interactive manner. In this project, we have implemented state-of-the-art deep learning
models for Question Answering such as transformer models roberta and distilbert For
training the model, we have used SQUAD and SELQA data sets. The implementation
uses two approaches - Haystack extractive QA pipeline and vertex AI to deploy the
endpoint. The project implementation resulted in an end-to-end production-ready
pipeline for the Question answering model.
